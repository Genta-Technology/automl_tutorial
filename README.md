Here's the improved and corrected version of your **Kolosal AutoML Tutorial README**:

# Kolosal AutoML Tutorial

This repository demonstrates how to use **Kolosal AutoML** to train, evaluate, and explain a regression model using the California Housing dataset.

## 🚀 What You'll Learn

* How to load and prepare data
* How to train a model using Kolosal AutoML
* How to evaluate model performance
* How to generate a performance report
* How to generate model explainability insights

## 📦 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Genta-Technology/automl_tutorial.git
cd automl_tutorial
```

### 2. Set Up the Environment Using `uv`

#### a. (Optional) Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### b. Install `uv` and Sync Dependencies

Install `uv` (a faster pip replacement):

```bash
pip install uv
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip sync requirements.lock.txt
```

> `uv` is a fast dependency manager that automatically uses `pyproject.toml` for locking and syncing environments.

### 3. Run the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook tutorial.ipynb
```

## 📁 Files

* `tutorial.ipynb` – Main notebook tutorial
* `requirements.lock.txt` – Locked dependency versions
* `README.md` – This file

## ✅ Requirements

* Python 3.8+
* Jupyter Notebook
* Kolosal AutoML
* scikit-learn
* `uv` for dependency management
